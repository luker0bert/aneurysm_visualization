aneurysm_visualization
======================

CIS 410 Visualization final project
For my final project in my scientific visualization class, I wrote python scripts and ran them through VisItâ€™s python interface to create animation frames for a short video. The video provides a simulation of blood flow over time during an aneurysm. I chose to represent the data first using pathlines, and then with translucent contours. The <a href="http://www.visitusers.org/index.php?title=Tutorial_Data">dataset</a> I used for this project is available on the VisIt users wiki. The frames were edited together with Final Cut Pro.
